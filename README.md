# Little_YOLOv4
This description is up-to-date as of 08/09/20. Little_YOLOv4 is a CUDA C++ computer-vision / object-detection solution based on the much larger darknet / YOLOv4 API. Little_YOLOv4 detects objects in images. The Little_YOLOv4 folder within this repository contains 19 C structure-definition files; 1 VCXProj file; and 157 pairs of a function declaration file and a function definition file. darknet-master.zip (downloaded on 06/09/20) was 8.005 MB; Little_YOLOv4.zip is 0.274 MB. darknet (downloaded 06/09/20) when set up to detect objects in dog.jpg is 374 MB; Little_YOLOv4 when set up to detect objects in dog.jpg is 271 MB, 251 MB of which are the weights (i.e., the memory) of the YOLOv4 CNN. darknet uses 5 GB of RAM to detect objects in dog.jpg; Little_YOLOv4 uses 3 GB of RAM to detect objects in dog.jpg.
